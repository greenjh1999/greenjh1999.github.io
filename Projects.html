    <h2 class="quote-tool">Python Quote Gui</h2>
    <p class="projects-p1">My very first project I created was a tool for work. I work in cellular sales at the moment. In the industry we have to quote customers based on criteria involving number of phone lines, insuarnce, cost of the device installment (we call it DP or device payment) and trade in promotional credits. Do help me quote better I created a very basic python GUI with Tkinter and linked it to in-line dictionary wich stored all the devices, prices and cost based on number of lines. It had a few bugs but i was quote proud of my first GUI project. I never got much use out of it cuz it was very strict in use.</p>
    <h2>"The good Ole Calculator"</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite projects I worked on was just a few months ago. I found this very interesting tkinter extention on github called Custom Tkinter or CustomTk. It was very interesting so I decided to coded up a basic calculator with this newly discovered framework. It was Actually quite fun and i believe it was one of the projects i learned the most about.</p>

    <h2>"My React and Javascript Journey"</h2>
    <p>So, Javascript this language is so insanely powerful its actually mind boggling! I first heard about react just a few months ago. I decided I wasnted to learn it too!. Hay according to StackOverflow its one of the most widely used javascript frameworks beating out angular and vue by a long margin. I decided to learn it downloaded all my dependencies node.js, prettier, es-lint. Opened up my command line types in npm create-react-app my_app, waited.....then wow. I was so severly confused it took me days to even figure out how to create a new component. That ultimately made me think "I need some HTML, CSS and, JS experience first". That leads me to this project. This is my first "Real" website. I plan to update it as I get more experience in the world of web development!</p>
