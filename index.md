<p class="name">Hi, my name is<span>John Green.</span></p>

<h2 class="learning-class">I Love Learning to <span>Program!</span></h2>

<p class="script">Im an IT student who loves programming and <span>CODE!</span><p>
</p>

<p class="name-me">Currently I work in Retail sales, but im trying to get
my programing skills up to be a fullstack <span>DEV</span> some day!</p>
<p>I am currently Enrolled in Souther New Hampshire University. I spend most of my free time learning programming, and devloper concepts. Currently I am developing this webpage solely to sharpen my Html, Css and Javascript Skills!</p>
<h2 class="python">Python!</h2>
<p>My first Step in the door to the programming world was a fun little language called Python. It is a general multi purpose multi paradigm language first created in the 1990s. Its syntax is very simple and fairly simple to pick up. Some of the best frameworks for it include Pytorch, Tkinter, Matplotlib, just to name a few!</p>
<h2 class="python">HTML and CSS</h2>
<p>The next thing I moved onto was HTML and CSS hypertext-markup language and Cascading stylesheet. Now I've heard of some really nice frameworks for both of these languaes. HTML has mainly Javascript libraries like React, Vue.js, svelte, and Angular aswell as Node. And Css has bootstrap, SAAS and w3.css. These are all fair and dandy, buy I started with just attempting to get the basics under my belt. I found a lovely corse on <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/">FrontEndMasters</a> masters by Jen kramer a front end developer and instructor. She tought me most of the basic and intermediate HTML and Css and thanks to her, this is how im writing this website right now.</p>
<h2 class="python">JavaScript</h2>
<p>Javascript is what makes the internet, and webpages do stuff. Javascript like the name may depict, is a scripting languages similar to python in a way. Its object oriented and very flexible. There is a saying "Anything that can be programmed in another language, will ultimately be programmed in Javascript" and i believe this name holds true. What cant javascript do? My first taste of javascript i did it all wrong. I tried to go straight to typescript, a language that compiles down directly to javascript. That only lasted a few days before I said to Hell with it. I need to learn Vanilla JS! I found another great corse on Frontendmasters called Complete Intro to React taught by Briant Holt. This corse was great, but I found out quickly I just dont know anything about plain old javascript. I didnt even know what document.GetElementById did or why it did what it did. So my current learning curiculum is trying to master the early stages of Javascript!</p>
<h2>My Future Endeavors Goals for 2023</h2>
<p>As I continue to learn everyday I have pinpointed some things I hope to Learn in the Year 2023!</p>
<li>React</li>
<p>I believe the future is React, and the StackOverflow surveys prove it. Ranked as the 6th mose used Framework beating out two of its competitors Angular and Vue. I believe this is a technology that is worth the learning curve. Its virtual dom and component oriented nature realy makes this framework shine. And I cant wait to get it under my belt.</p>
<li>Databases</li>
<p>Databases are something I have no experience in and would like to. Databases are the best way to store large amounts of data and pairs of values. I hope to truely master this technology this year!</p>
<li>VS Code</li>
<p>This may be a wierd one to some. I use VS code for pretty much everything and have a good grasp on it. But the features it has in my opinion can take a very long time to fully master. With its hundres of plugins, debugging modes, and add-ons VS Code is a very powerful programming IDE and in my opinion the only real IDE you need!</p>
